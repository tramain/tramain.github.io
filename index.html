		<h2 id = "skills">My Skills</h2>
		<p>Over the course of the past six months, I've been able to learn new abilities alongside enhancing previous ones. Here is a small list of the many things I have to offer:</p>

		<p> Hardware: </p>
		<p> Desktop Troubleshooting, Computer Assembling, Computer Maintenance </p>
		<p> Software: </p>
		<p> Microsoft Office, Python, HTML CSS </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="hexagon_4">	
		<h2 id = "portfolio">Portfolio</h2>
		<p>With experience across IT, volunteer work, community service, and many relevant skills, you'll find that my portfolio is expansive.</p>

		<p> I am knowledgeable with computer hardware and how to troubleshoot them, using problem solving and critical thinking in the process. I've also learned how to troubleshoot software during my time at Year Up. I've learned several programs in the Microsoft Office suite, and I have also learned how to create websites through coding languages called HTML and CSS, with this site(still a work in progress!) being a example. I am yet to be A+ certified, but I plan on being certified before summer 2016.</p>

		<p> I try to work with the community as much as possible. During my time at Year Up, I've completed several hours of volunteer work. I've also joined the Groundswell project which is dedicated to create a mural for Year Up that will create a change for future generations.</p>
		<p>I'm also working on a business plan, called "Throwback Cafe". While business isn't my stong suit, I hope to one day run a business of my own, with this current plan being a test run.</p>
